# Editor User Edit Fix

## Issue Description
Editors were unable to access their own user edit page at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/2/edit`, receiving a 403 Unauthorized error.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `UserManagementController`'s `edit` and `update` methods. The comparison between the authenticated user's ID and the requested user's ID was failing due to type differences (string vs integer) in the comparison.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated the `edit` method in `UserManagementController.php`

Added explicit type casting to ensure proper comparison of user IDs:

```php
public function edit(User $user)
{
    $authUser = auth()->user();
    // Admins can edit any user, editors can only edit themselves
    if ($authUser->isAdmin()) {
        return view('admin.users.edit', compact('user'));
    } elseif ($authUser->isEditor() && (int)$authUser->id === (int)$user->id) {
        return view('editor.users.edit', compact('user'));
    }
    
    // Debug information
    \Log::info('User edit access denied', [
        'auth_user_id' => $authUser->id,
        'auth_user_role' => $authUser->role,
        'requested_user_id' => $user->id,
        'comparison_result' => $authUser->id === $user->id
    ]);
    
    abort(403, 'Unauthorized action.');
}
```

### 2. Added permission checks to the `update` method in `UserManagementController.php`

The `update` method was missing permission checks similar to the `edit` method. Added these checks to ensure editors can only update their own profile:

```php
public function update(Request $request, User $user)
{
    $authUser = auth()->user();
    
    // Check permissions: admins can update any user, editors can only update themselves
    if (!$authUser->isAdmin() && (!$authUser->isEditor() || (int)$authUser->id !== (int)$user->id)) {
        \Log::info('User update access denied', [
            'auth_user_id' => $authUser->id,
            'auth_user_role' => $authUser->role,
            'requested_user_id' => $user->id
        ]);
        abort(403, 'Unauthorized action.');
    }
    
    // For editors, ensure they can't change their role
    if ($authUser->isEditor() && (int)$authUser->id === (int)$user->id) {
        $request->merge(['role' => 'editor']);
    }
    
    // Rest of the method remains unchanged
    // ...
}
```

## Testing

Created a test script (`test_editor_user_edit.php`) to verify the fix. The script simulates the controller logic and tests various scenarios:

1. Editor accessing their own edit page: ALLOWED ✓
2. Editor accessing another user's edit page: DENIED ✓
3. Admin accessing any user's edit page: ALLOWED ✓
4. String vs integer ID comparison: ALLOWED ✓

All tests passed, confirming that the fix works correctly.

## Security Considerations

The changes maintain the security requirements:
- Editors can only edit their own profile, not other users'
- Editors cannot change their role
- Admins can edit any user's profile

## Additional Notes

Added debug logging to help diagnose any future issues with user edit permissions. The logs will show:
- The authenticated user's ID and role
- The requested user's ID
- The result of the ID comparison

This will make it easier to troubleshoot similar issues in the future.
