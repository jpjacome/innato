# Editor Password Validation Fix

## Issue Description

The editor profile edit page was showing the error "The password field confirmation does not match" even when users were not attempting to change their password. This occurred when users tried to update other profile information (like their name) while leaving the password fields empty.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the validation rules in the `UserController@update` method. The password field was defined with the following validation rules:

```php
'password' => 'nullable|string|min:8|confirmed'
```

Even though the `nullable` rule allows the field to be empty, the `confirmed` validation rule was still being applied regardless of whether the password field was filled. This meant that Laravel was always checking for a matching `password_confirmation` field, even when the user wasn't trying to change their password.

## Solution

The solution was to modify the validation rules to only apply the `confirmed` rule when the password field is actually filled. This was done by:

1. Creating a separate `$rules` array for validation
2. Adding the basic validation rules for name and email
3. Conditionally adding password validation rules only when the password field is filled

Here's the updated code:

```php
// Create validation rules array
$rules = [
    'name' => 'required|string|max:255',
    'email' => 'required|string|email|max:255|unique:users,email,' . $user->id,
];

// Only apply password validation if the password field is filled
if ($request->filled('password')) {
    $rules['password'] = 'string|min:8|confirmed';
}

$request->validate($rules);
```

With this change, the `confirmed` validation rule is only applied when the user is actually trying to change their password. If they leave the password field empty, no validation will be performed on it, and they won't get the "password confirmation does not match" error.

## Verification

After making this change, users should be able to:

1. Update their profile information (name, email) without entering anything in the password fields
2. Still be required to provide a matching confirmation when they do want to change their password

## Technical Explanation

Laravel's `confirmed` validation rule requires a matching field with the name `{field}_confirmation`. In this case, it's looking for `password_confirmation`. The issue was that even when the password field was empty, Laravel was still applying the `confirmed` rule and checking for a matching confirmation field.

By using the `$request->filled('password')` check, we now only apply the password validation rules when the user has actually entered something in the password field. This is a more user-friendly approach that allows users to update their profile information without having to deal with password fields if they don't want to change their password.

## Recommendations

1. **Conditional Validation**: When using validation rules that depend on the presence of a field, consider using conditional validation to only apply those rules when needed.

2. **Clear User Instructions**: Ensure form labels and help text clearly indicate which fields are optional and what requirements exist for those fields.

3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test form submissions with various combinations of filled and empty fields to ensure validation works as expected in all scenarios.

4. **Validation Best Practices**: For password fields in update forms, always make them optional and only validate them when they're actually filled. This allows users to update other information without having to re-enter their password.
