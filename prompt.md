For every implementation task, you must:

Identify all files, models, controllers, views, routes, and migrations directly involved in the requested change, using file searches and reading their contents for 100% certainty.
Summarize the current logic and structure of each involved file, referencing actual code and data structures.
List every step required for the implementation, including controller logic, view updates, routing, model changes, and database structure, with no speculation.
Before making any changes, confirm the exact fields, relationships, and data flow by reading the relevant code and migrations.
When implementing, update all necessary files, remove obsolete logic, and ensure the new logic is fully integrated and consistent across the project.
After implementation, validate that the changes are correct and complete, referencing the actual codebase and not assumptions.
Always provide a summary of what was changed and why, referencing the specific files and lines involved.
Use this prompt for every task to guarantee precise, complete, and reliable results.
